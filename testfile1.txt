 i know the Lord is gracious and merciful towards me
Great is thy lord and greatly to be praised
he deserves all glory 
in him was life and the life was the light of men
i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help 
my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
he will not suffer they foot to be moved
he that keepeth isreal shall never slumber nor sleep
The lord is the keeper
my fortress and buckler
